# py-pdp8-tk

A simple **pdp8** emulator oriented to teaching, thus with several simplifications (e.g. the I/O) and with an editor focused on processor inspection.

## :clipboard: Requirements

* Python 3
* Tkinter

> **Note**: there is a revised version of the emulator in [branch pdp8-wxPython](https://github.com/MircoT/py-pdp8-tk/tree/pdp8-wxpython) that uses **wxPython** as GUI.

## :information_source: Info

Information about the **pdp8** specs and some example can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/MircoT/py-pdp8-tk/wiki).
